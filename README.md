# orbital-core

The shared foundation of the Orbital compiler: the IR/OIR types, the expression evaluator, the runtime kernel, effects, schema and the readers over the installed Almadar language data.

Part of [Almadar](https://almadar.io)'s Orbital compiler, which turns a `.lolo`/`.orb` program into a full-stack app. The `orb` CLI (npm `@almadar/orb`) bundles this crate; you only need this repo to read, build or change it.

Depends on no other Orbital crate.

## Layout

- `src/` — the crate.

## Build and test

The crate reads the Almadar language data (patterns, operators, themes, vocabularies) from the installed npm packages, so install those first:

```bash
npm install --no-save --no-package-lock @almadar/core@^10 @almadar/std@^16 @almadar/lolo-ar@^1 @almadar/lolo-sl@^1
cargo test
```
